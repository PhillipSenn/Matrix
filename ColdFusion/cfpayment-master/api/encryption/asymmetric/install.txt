 ANT Build Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.In order to use ANT Tool you have to  install  Apache ANT Tool in your system.

2.Download ANT  Tool from "http://www.devlib.org/apache/ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.7.0-bin.zip".

3.Unzip the file and paste it any where you want (For example  C:\Ant ).

4. Set the ANT_HOME and JAVA_HOME environment variables and add them to your PATH.

1. Download  "bcprov-jdk14-136.jar"  "from http://ftp.cica.es/mirrors/maven2/bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk14/136/"

2. Put the jar file "bcprov-jdk14-136.jar" in "<coldfusion intalled directory>\runtime\jre\lib\ext"  directory. 

   [ Note: If the jar file is put to any other directory, the Java and JVM Class path needs to be set in the Coldfusion Administrator. The path
     needs to be the full physical path containing the jar file name. ]



Project Setup.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Put the java file to any desired directory of your project folder. [For example "<project root>\java"].

2. Put the component cfc file to any desired directory of your project folder. [For example "<project root>\cfc"].

3. Put the "build.xml" file to any desired path. 

4. Next you need to edit the "build.xml" file with few paths.
   There are mainly 4 properties whose path needs to be set.

    <property name="src" location="path to source java file"/>
    <property name="dist" location="destination path for jar file"/>	
    <property name="classes" location="destination path for class file"/>
    <property name="bcjar" location="path for the bcprov-jdk14-136.jar file"/>

   The location attribute of property "src" needs to be path where the java file is kept. For example "<project root>\java".
   The location attribute of property "dist" needs to be the destination path where the jar file will be extracted. For example "<project root>\build\jar".
   The location attribute of property "classes" needs to be the destination path where the class file will be extracted. For example "<project root>\build\classes".
   The location attribute of property "bcjar" needs to be path where the bcprov-jdk14-136.jar file is kept. For example "<project root>\bouncycastlejar".

5.Now, in order to run the "build.xml" file go to the directory where "build.xml" file is  present  using command line and then type  "ant" in the command line .
    And pressing  enter would create the required jar and class files in the specified directories.

6. Set  the Java and JVM Class path for the generated jar file in Coldfusion Administrator.

7. Restart Coldfusion Administrator.

8. Now the cfc methods can be used.
