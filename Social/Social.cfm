<p>Social is all the rage right now. Google Plus has shown that people are wanting social.</p>
<p>What can be done to help the newbie break in?</p>
<p>Here's an idea - You've got these questions of the day, but instead of automated grading, have it be human graded. That way you can ask more open-ended questions like:</p>
<p>How would you implement dragging something from one div into another?</p>
<p>Let me think about how StackOverflow has changed everything...</p>
<p>There, you've got people asking questions, and the experts answering them.</p>
<p>But with my idea, it's the newbie working through a known set of questions.</p>
<p>Q: So who's going to grade the answers? <br>
	A: 
You are!</p>
<p>Q: What if you get an email that says: &quot;How would you implement dragging something from one div into another?&quot; followed by the code to do so. You have the ability to answer A) Correct, B) Incorrect and also a comment field. The person gets an email from an anonymous source saying whether they got the answer correct or not.</p>
<p>I suppose they could move on to the next question without waiting on your response.</p>
