<p>The whiplash anti-pattern</p>
<p>This is when the author mentions an advanced concept during an introductory phase of the subject.</p>
<p>An example would be mentioning closure during an introduction to jQuery.</p>
<p>Sometimes the authors notice this themselves and apologize for it in advance, but that doesn't stop them from mentioning it.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't pay attention to this right now, but in the future you'll want to know about X&quot;.</p>
