<p>Find the method called Index in the documentation</p>

<p>Problem: There are two ways to refresh the page. One clears the input elements back to their original state. The other refreshes the JavaScript cache.</p>
<p>Problem: The same word is used in different contexts. &quot;HTML&quot; could mean &quot;HTML&quot; or a method called &quot;html&quot;. INPUT could mean the INPUT tag, or a :input filter.</p>
<p>Problem: Terminology. What's a method, element, node?</p>

<p>Problem: Certain pitfalls need to be avoided, and there are known workarounds.</p>
<p>I'm not arguing that this is something you need to know - especially if you're looking at someone else's code. But this is how I do it, so I'm not going to show you every possible side street you can go down. This is the straight and narrow.</p>
