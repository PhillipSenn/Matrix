<h1>When to use jQuery</h1>
<p>The plan is to create a JavaScript matrix next. It will have a usage column as well. If the usage is &quot;No&quot; for a variety of reasons, then the alternative will be posted in the notes column.</p>
<p>Quite often the alternative is jQuery, but every now and then, the notes will say &quot;Do not use - ever&quot;.</p>
<p>At once point in Crockford's talk, he says &quot;I can't say to never use this feature - well, yes I can - don't ever use this feature&quot;.</p>
