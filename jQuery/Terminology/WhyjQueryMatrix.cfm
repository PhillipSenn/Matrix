<title>Why a jQuery Matrix</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>The idea started with a JavaScript matrix, because JavaScript is huge (JavaScript: The Definitive Guide is 1078 pages, but JavaScript: The Good Parts is 176 pages). Not only are there lots of part that are not good, a lot of parts have been supplanted by jQuery. </p>
<p>As I read books, I wanted to start taking notes, but where? Write them in the margins? All the problems associated with paper came out - single instance, not searchable... So I knew the answer had to be in an online environment where I could pull it up from home or the office. I pulled up my favorite HTML editor, which is never far away, and just started typing.</p>
<p>I thought I should do a jQuery matrix first so that when I'm doing a JavaScript matrix, I'll know what parts can be replaced by jQuery. I will never use getElementById for instance.</p>
<p>Prior to the <a href="http://jquery14.com/day-01/jquery-14">1.4 release</a>, I personally have a hard time navigating around in the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/">jQuery API</a>, and the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page">jQuery docs</a> pages. So I would buy books and watch videos. The problem with that is that jQuery was evolving so quickly that books in print were already out of date and the authors naturally were limited to what they themselves knew.</p>

<p>The phrase &quot;anti-patterns&quot; has become popular, meaning &quot;a pattern that may be commonly used but is ineffective&quot; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">Wikipedia</a>). I think there are some <a href="../../Matrix/TeachingAntiPatterns/Index.cfm">teaching anti-patterns</a> as well (<a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/#jQuery-data1">Example</a>). </p>
<p>As I read books and watch videos, there are certains things that I pick up that aren't mentioned anywhere else. So I need a single repository to store all the tidbits that I pick up. Also, I need to know &quot;Have I read this already? Do I know this? Oh yeah, I know this&quot;.</p>
