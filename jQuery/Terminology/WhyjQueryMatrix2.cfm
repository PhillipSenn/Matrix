<p>There are also pieces of advice like &quot;Don't use this feature&quot;, that I need to know about. Any time someone says not to use a certain feature, that's because they've spent a lot of time on it and have concluded that it's not worth the effort. If someone says not to use something, I want to at least know about the danger signals before entering ahead. It's especially useful if they tell you what to use instead.</p>
<p>I feel there are levels of learning. If you are new to a subject, you want introductory topics. Your time is at a premium. We talk so much about saving programmer's time when it comes to development. What about saving  time when it comes to training?</p>
<p>One thing certain authors do is slip in an advanced topic while explaining something introductory. jQuery.noConflict is an example.  Yes, you need to know about noConflict - you just don't need to know about when you're working on &quot;Hello World&quot;.</p>
<p>Another example is that the keyword 'undefined' can be redefined. While that's true, you probably don't have to worry about that if you're learning about variables. </p>
<p>With books, there is a certain degree of putting two or three topics together in order to fit within a certain page limit. With a web site, there's no need to worry about how much space two examples take up compared to one super example.</p>
<p>And the problem is: I'm just slow. I go home and I think about what it is I just ready and a lot of times, it's like they've inferred what it is they're trying teach. I need someone to beat me over the head with an example that you can't get away from.</p>
<p>There is a tendancy to explain multiple variations of a solution. While this is admirable, because every situation is different, I wouldn't mind seeing an author say &quot;This is how I do it&quot;.</p>
