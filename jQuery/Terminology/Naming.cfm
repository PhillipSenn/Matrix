<p>An explanation of my naming convention is in order:		</p>
<ul>
	<li>X - This variable is used whenever a single variable is needed in the example			
	<li>#myID -	This	identifier	is used whenever a unique location on the dom is the most appropriate example
	<li>A,B,C,D - These variables are used whenever more	than	one	variable is required in the example
	<li>this - The <em>this</em> keyword is core	to JavaScript programming. It is implied. In other words, it's not explicitly passed, but it's part of that function's scope all the same.  Be careful if you move code that uses the <em>this</em> keyword to a function, because the context will have changed.
</ul>
