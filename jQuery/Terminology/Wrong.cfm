<p>1. Refresh</p>
<p>There are two types of refresh - Address bar refresh and page refresh.</p>
<p>Pressing Alt-D and then Enter is like navigating to the page anew, except it doesn't refresh the JavaScript or CSS.</p>
<p>Pressing refresh will refresh the JavaScript and CSS, but maintains radio button and checkbox state.</p>
<p>I will often do both in order to refresh the page, Alt-D, Enter, AND refresh.</p>
<p>2. ftp</p>
<p>Make sure your file is indeed on the server that you're browsing to. Sometimes Dreamweaver will take a while to ftp up to the server, and sometimes it will simply stall. For some reason this has bitten me more at home than at work, even though I'm on charter.net in both locations.</p>
