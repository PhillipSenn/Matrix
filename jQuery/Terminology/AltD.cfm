<h1>Alt+D</h1>
<p>In order to clear the inputs back to their original state, I use Alt+D to put the cursor into the address bar and then press Enter.</p>
<p>This is like navigating to the page anew.  If you were to press F5 (or the refresh button), then your inputs would retain their current values.</p>
<p>While programming in JavaScript, make sure you press F5 to refresh the page.
