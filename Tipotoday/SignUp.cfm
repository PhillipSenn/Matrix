<p>Todo: Sign up for a tip of the day. </p>
<p>The tip o' today should not be one way only - it should be a question that once answered correctly will allow you to ge the next tip.</p>
<p>But what if they don't answer at all? Will it SPAM them with the same tip over and over again? Maybe step down the frequency to a tip o' the week.</p>
<p>What if they answer it incorrectly? I should allow a &quot;skip&quot; option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do you do that? It would no longer just be an example, but would be a setup followed by multiple choice.</p>
<p>In the case of ASCII Matrix, it could be a single keyboard entry - &quot;What's Char(65)?&quot; Maybe have a special condition if they enter a lowercase 'a' vs. an uppercase 'A'.</p>
<p>In that sense, it's no longer a tip of the day, but has become a question of the day.</p>
