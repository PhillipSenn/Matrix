<p>Where do matrices appear already? Anywhere that requires a comprehensive listing of features:</p>
<p>Here's a few I could think of off the top of my head:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.ascii-code.com/">ASCII chart</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.html-color-names.com/color-chart.php">HTML color names</a><br>
	Any mention of color requires a link to <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/">kuler</a>. </li>
	<li><a href="http://www.webelements.com/">Periodic Table of Elements</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that I look at the ASCII chart, it could use a little prioritizing as well.</p>
<p>There's not much you could do with a color chart though - maybe group some complementary colors and say &quot;for beginning users, limit your self to these colors only&quot;.</p>
<p>Periodic Table of Elements? Maybe by the year they were discovered. I'm sure there's all different categories you could group the elements into. Lanthanoids and Actinoids come immediately to mind.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.orientaltable.com/menu/menu.html">Oriental Table menu</a> <br>
		I include this because everyone can identify with food.
		<br>
	It'd be nice to know what you had before. Maybe a filter on ingredients (beef fried rice, beef Lo Mein), anything without peanuts.</li>
</ul>
