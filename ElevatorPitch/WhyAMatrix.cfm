<p>Google has certainly changed the way that we learn. Today you can find an answer to any question instantaneously. And usually the answer is a very good answer, too. I'm not knocking Google.</p>
<p>Social media is revolutionizing learning as well. Take a site like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. This is where you can ask a very technical question and a human being will take time to answer it. I personally wear <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/111665/cf-phillipsenn">stackoverflow</a> out.</p>
<p>Then there is the more traditional learning - reading books. This is where the author covers the subject in depth. There are things in the book that you don't know enough to even ask a question about. You couldn't ask a question about a certain topic because you didn't even know it existed.</p>
<p>That's what a matrix is for. It's a way for you to scan through a particular subject, making sure that you know about all the topics.</p>
<p>There needs to be a comprehensive list. It doesn't have to be in alphabetic order. It just needs to be comprehensive.</p>
<p>Q: Why not just read a reference book?</p>
<p>A: A reference book, being sorted alphabetically, usually starts with ! or # or some other obscure feature that is only used by the most advanced developers.</p>
